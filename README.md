<h1>Structural Engineering Website</h1>
<p>
  &emsp;This is my Structural Engineering Website! I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate at the University
  of Pittsurgh in the Swanson School of Engineering Civil Engineering program with The
  a focus in structural engineering. I hope to use this website to further organize some of the important
  concepts that I have learned so far in the program, and to add many of the concepts that I will learn in the future.
  Eventually, I plan on attending a graduate school to get my Master's degree in Structural Engineering. One of the things
  that I am most interested in is specifically Bridge Design.
  <br /><br />&emsp;In this website take notice of the various pages that are provided. The "Types of Bridges" page list some
  of the most common bridge strucutres used around the world. Obviously the a bridge is not limited to just one of these
  design types. There are many variations of these types of bridges in the world today. The "Fundamentals" page will be
  used to discuss some of the fundamental concepts in structural engineering. This page is still in development, but eventually
  I will continue to add more to this webpage. The "About me" page is used to provide my resume for anyone who is interested.
  I would like to add more information about my work experience as I move foward in my Career.
  <br /><br />&emsp;Also, take notice to some of the features that can be used on this website. There area many different ways the user
  can change the theme of this website from "dark" to "light" mode. Feel free to play around with this feature. There is also
  a live 24 hour clock. The menu button on the far right will open up the navigation bar to the other webpages available on the website.
