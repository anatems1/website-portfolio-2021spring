    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>This is the basics of HTML</p>


    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site.
    There are six levels of headings</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is how you make ordered lists</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>Ol wraps everything for you</li>
    </ol>

    <hr />

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>This is for italics</em></p>
    <p>Inline and block elements. The p element is a block element and the em element is and inline element.
      <br />Inline elements affect the span of text inside the paragraph
      <br />This is for <strong>Stongs or bold text</strong>. It is basically the equivalent of shouting (in Web Typography)
    </p>
    <p>HTML is used for stucture or <em>semantic</em> information and CSS is used for <em>presentational</em> information</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules</h2>
    <p>Line breaks ..br.. should be used in a meaningful way,
      <br />it should not be used to add a bunch of space in between paragraphs
    </p>
